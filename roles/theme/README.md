# Theme role

this role handles cross-platform theme setup, including wallpaper placement.

## What it does

- places wallpaper images in `/usr/share/backgrounds/`

## Notes

- this role only handles making the wallpaper files available in standard locations, the actual wallpaper setting is handled by platform-specific roles (e.g., `gnome` for GNOME desktop)
