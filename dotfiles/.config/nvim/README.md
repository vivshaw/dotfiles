# nvim config

my neovim config. a significant WIP.

## To install

```
ln -s ~/dotfiles/nvim ~/.config/nvim
```

## Quickstart

- `;f` to grep filenames
- `;r` to grep 

## TODO

 - no snippets installed
 - barbecue.nvim might be nicer than bufferline? tbd
 - Git line is slightly jacked- shows a big grey space
 - figure out Vim tabs? not sure if I need that.
