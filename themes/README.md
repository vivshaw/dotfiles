# Setup

I like Dracula. it's easy on the eyes, good for programming, and available on just about everything. consistency, ease, and familiarity let me focus on what matters. Unfortunately, it is challenging to configure theming programmatically, so much of this visual polish is manual.

## Specific apps to theme:

- **Logseq** - https://draculatheme.com/logseq
- **VSCode** - https://draculatheme.com/visual-studio-code
- **Slack** - https://draculatheme.com/slack
- if Linux:
  - **Gnome Terminal** - https://draculatheme.com/gnome-terminal
  - **GTK** - https://draculatheme.com/gtk
  - **Gnome Tweaks** (to apply the theme and further visual tweaks)
  - **Disable the dock, if on Ubuntu** - `gnome-extensions disable ubuntu-dock@ubuntu.com`
- if Windows:
  - **Windows Terminal** - https://draculatheme.com/windows-terminal
  - Windows can't be configured with a Dracula theme, but standard dark theme with a `#BD93F9` highlight is Good Enough™️
- if Mac:
  - **iTerm** - https://draculatheme.com/iterm
