# Setup

i like Dracula. it's easy on the eyes, good for programming, and available on just about everything. consistency, ease, and familiarity let me focus on what matters.

## Specific apps to theme:

  - **GTK** - https://draculatheme.com/gtk
- if Windows:

  - Windows can't be configured with a Dracula theme, but standard dark theme with a `#BD93F9` highlight is Good Enough™️
