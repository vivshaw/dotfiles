# Why these fonts?

I like to use [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k), which requires a patched font to render its fancy glyphs. [MesloLGS is the dev's recommended font](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k?tab=readme-ov-file#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k), and it's Good Enough™️ for me.
