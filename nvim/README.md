# nvim config

My nvim config. A significant WIP.

## To install

```
ln -s ~/dotfiles/nvim ~/.config/nvim
```

## TODO

 - No snippets installed
 - Bufferline doesn't work (only shows current buffer)
 - barbecue.nvim might be nicer than bufferline? tbd
 - Git line is slightly jacked- shows a big grey space
